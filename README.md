# UltimateStoryteller_BasilicusPatch
This patch adds support for the storyteller Basilicus Bestower from Vanilla Psycasts Expanded. When enabled, the Ultimate Storyteller will include an adjustable RNG chance of pawns spawning with psycasts, like Basilicus Bestower also does. RNG Settings are seperate between Basilicus and the Ultimate Storyteller, you -should- be able to run both with seperate chances.

You're free to do whatever you want with it, the code is a mess and was cobbled together while sleep deprivated. Enjoy(?)
